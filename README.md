# Estimating the Credibility of Past Research

A Master's-level course taught at the Institute of Psychology at University of Bern.



## Change to make to the next cycle of the course 

### Add to every weeks' assignments

- choose 1+ article that meets the requirement for that week, so that if each student's assigned articles dont contain the thing to be extracted, the default fourth article does and they can use it to practice the tool either way.

### Session 2

- add line to slides about how for an industry whose primary product is mean to be true knowledge we have fewer quality control processes than most other industries. There are more standards, laws, and requirements on me to make shoes, or bread, or pour concrete, or do accounting. 
- slides briefly mention existing quality control mechanisms like peer review and funding. excellent follow up questions about how they work, how reviewers are found, how funders dont check good science was done, etc. put some of this in slides.
- statcheck assignment google sheet might have missed some columns, make sure it includes decision error. emphasise that people have to download the csv and upload it rather than copy paste, as one uses ticks and one text. or, fork steves repo and make a custom app that solves this.
  - FORK STEVES ONE AND MAKE A NEW ONE THAT GIVES THE FULL ORIGINAL TEST STAT AND DF FOR P CURVE, PLUS THE RESULTS WE NEED TO SUMMARIZE STATCHECK

### Session 3

add the background of right turn on red to the slides from the wrong turn on red - background.pdf

for the assignment, add additional items that give corrective feedback and aren't scored to help them learn before the quiz itself. 

### Session 4

Add additional readings on each of the checklist's items

Add guidance for how to apply the checklist

### Session 5

Change instructions for assignment: scrutiny can't handle empty rows.

Ask lukas for advice on how to get quoted text in the data to be checked, so it doesn't add decimal places.
