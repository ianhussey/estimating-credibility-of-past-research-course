"Sometimes its easy to lose perspective on the big questions, such as “why do scientists do science?” We are often told that we do science to discover truth. If this is the only reason errors and fraud would be rare, but there is growing concern they are not (Van Noreen, 2023; Simply Science, 2023; Smith, 2021).
