southern italians have the some of the greatest life expectancy in the world, eg huge numbers of people over 100 years old. Why?

- Newman 2024 "Supercentenarian and remarkable age records exhibit patterns indicative of clerical errors and pension fraud" - not diet or genes, just poor record keeping and pension fraud. 



The maternal death rate - the proportion of women who die during pregnancy - in the USA has more than doubled in the last 20 years. Why?

- It had previously been underestimated, and over time states have adopted a standardized tick-box for recording deaths that has a) changed measurement over time and b) increased the observed rate of maternal deaths but not the underlying rate of women dying during pregnancy.

Mental health among adolescent girls in the US has gotten signfiicantly worse in the last 15 years, with many more cases of self harm and suicide attempts. Why?

- A common explanation of smartphones and social media, a case advanced by Jonathan Haidt despite not being a clinical psychologist or a competent researcher. 
- Obamacare made mental health screenings mandatory and covered by insurance for teenage girls. Administrative changes introduced a standardized form that recorded whether injuries were accidential or self inflicted. Together, the previously underestimated observed rate of self harm and suicide attempts in adolescent girls rose.
- “In 2011, as part of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a new set of guidelines that recommended that teenage girls should be screened annually for depression by their primary care physicians and that same year required that insurance providers cover such screenings in full. In 2015, H.H.S. finally mandated a coding change, proposed by the World Health Organization almost two decades before, that required hospitals to record whether an injury was self-inflicted or accidental — and which seemingly overnight nearly doubled rates for self-harm across all demographic groups. Soon thereafter, the coding of suicidal ideation was also updated. The effect of these bureaucratic changes on hospitalization data presumably varied from place to place. But in one place where it has been studied systematically, New Jersey, where 90 percent of children had health coverage even before the A.C.A., researchers have found that the changes explain nearly all of the state’s apparent upward trend in suicide-related hospital visits, turning what were “essentially flat” trendlines into something that looked like a youth mental health “crisis.” (Wallace-Wells, 2024, p. 2)



Contrast this with the "we have broken the speed of light" finding in physics where they were very cautious about interpreting the finding.
