- Mott and Bailey 

- add "a decade of theory in psych science"
  
- contrast with gloster - we didnt' need the novelty, we already know exposure is incredibly effective
  - oh no wait, gloster is fucked too, doesn't support his claims, when you recalculate it its far less effective.




we don't teach theory construction, we teach theory testing, so theory gets replaced with hypothesis testing, surrogates, and lists of dichotomies.

we dont even test theories that often - decade of theory in psych science

not even wrong + strategic ambiguity

best theory is a bad one



# Assignment

- is a theory mentioned?
- is a hypothesis mentioned?
- what is the hypothesis?
  - how confident are you?
- Is the hypothesis/theory ambiguous?
  - Is there a risk that it benefits from that ambiguity?
- is the hypothesis/theory extremely tight?

Give two examples in class, one good and one bad, have them discuss as a group.

Take home assignment is on their own papers.
